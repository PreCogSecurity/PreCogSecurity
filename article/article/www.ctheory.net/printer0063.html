<b><p>Detroit-Techno </b>

<p>Compuware Headquarters, located at 1 Campus Martius near the base of Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit, marks the site of the new, urban
landscape. Compuware, a leading Information Technology corporation, manufactures management, software applications and offers IT services to a number
of global businesses. Where Detroit once signified the success and perils of Modernism, specifically those moments denoted by Fordist assembly line
methodology, today Detroit emerges as the signifier of techno-salvation. The lure of Compuware to Detroit, solidified in its 2003 opening, begins the
final replacement of industrialization with information technology. The sixteen story, $350 million building is now the focal point of what the city
itself calls "Digital Detroit," a title embodied in an annual conference of the same name.<a name="_ednref1"></a><a href="#_edn1">[1]</a> Wayne State
University contributes to this technology-driven enthusiasm with plans for its own downtown technology site, TechTown, a "new multi-million dollar
entrepreneurial village" "located along the Digital Drive in the heart of the city of Detroit."<a name="_ednref2"></a><a href="#_edn2">[2]</a>
Detroiter Iggy Pop's declaration "Look out, honey, cause I'm using technology," in the 1973 song "Search and Destroy," is no longer a threat, but
instead a desired reality as Detroit embraces the turn to the digital. This desire is realized in Digital Detroit, which dubs itself "New Ideas, New
Culture, New Community." The label updates the Fordist plan of "Americanization" in the early half of the 20th century with a digitized sense of urban
identity. Fordism triumphed homogenous identity for the sake of manufacturing; Digital Detroit triumphs "newness" in order to generate new media.

<p>The empty factories which initially gave birth to Ford and Chrysler supremacy throughout the first half of the 20th century have yielded to the
McLuhanist vision of information dominance. "In the new electric Age of Information and programmed production," Marshall McLuhan wrote in the 1960s,
"commodities themselves assume more and more the character of information."<a name="_ednref3"></a><a href="#_edn3">[3]</a> How has Detroit come to
represent the new signifier of urban information? How has its commodification placed urbanity at the center of new media logic? The commodification of
our cities (through franchises, capital, gentrification) has not yielded "better" places to live. No matter how many Hard Rock Cafés or Borders
we attract to downtown environments, life remains the same. Buildings remain unoccupied. Ruins surround the franchises. This paradox, the <i>Detroit
Free Press </i>notes, continues even as the city claims a high profile for attracting IT and other commercial investment. Upon hearing that Detroit
placed five companies in the 2005 Inner City 100 rankings of the fastest-growing companies in urban America, <i>Free Press</i> columnist Tom Walsh
comments:

<blockquote>

Detroit's emergence as one of the cities with the most companies on the Inner City 100 list is something of a surprise, given that an ICIC study last
year showed that Detroit was the only U.S. inner city with job losses of more than 2 percent a year from 1995 to 2001.<a name="_ednref4"></a><a
href="#_edn4">[4]</a>

</blockquote>

<p>Failure of economic investment (in terms of job growth or quality of life) has been largely ignored by cities, and Detroit, even with its faith in
Compuware, is no exception. Since the construction of the $500 million Ford-sponsored Renaissance Center along the Detroit River in 1977, economic
investment has served as the pivotal moment always-on-the-verge-of transforming the city's residents' lives. The Renaissance Center did not revive the
river area, and there's no reason to believe Compuware will save downtown. Like the Renaissance Center, the current grand scope of corporate IT
structure in downtown Detroit, aligned with the city's other grand gestures towards sports entertainment, have had little impact on the almost 800,000
residents' economic futures. Burnt out buildings, abandoned homes, and empty storefronts are still the norm. The anticipated domino effect of
development never materializes. Thus, despite his securing of the 2005 Super Bowl and The Final Four -- the 2009 collegiate basketball event -- for the city
to host, Detroit's mayor Kwame Kilpatrick is still named by <i>Time Magazine</i> as the country's worst mayor. Sports attractions meant to lure
further investment into the city have not generated substantial change. Why don't such efforts revive urban life anymore? The answer can be found in
the city's own claim to digital status: the role of information production, and in particular, new media.


<p><br>

<b><p>Assembly/Assemblage</b>

<p>One cannot discount the image of Compuware at Detroit's center. Its stature is notably visible against the backdrop of the numerous empty
storefronts in the adjacent section of Merchant's Row along Lower Woodward. The importance of Compuware is not that it has generated a significant
financial payoff; it hasn't. Compuware's importance is that the city now stands to be the site where a new logic of invention emerges, one based on
information technology. Detroit gave birth to the U.S. conception of assembly line thinking (equal parts in the system, interchangeability). Now
Detroit gives birth to the assemblage apparatus of new media. That Silicon Valley has been more of a force in the rise of information technology in
terms of hardware and software makes little difference. Detroit demonstrates not the instrumentality of digital culture, but its logic.

<p>We no longer live in the world of assembly. We live in the age of the assemblage. Assembling a city piece by piece through interchangeable
financial investments does not account for the assemblage mentality of the 21st century. As ubiquitous as assemblage has become for popular culture in
music, on TV, on the Web, and in the plastic arts, it still has not earned credit for its role in structuring logic. The logic of the assembly line
eventually extended outward from the Ford factory in Highland Park and influenced a range of cultural habits throughout the 20th century, from
department store setups (everything under one roof) to educational policy (assembly line movement from class to class and generalized testing). How
has assemblage begun to reimagine that structuring?

<p>The places we live in have become more than fixed places. "A rough enumeration of some of the basic tenets of this general narrative of the city
includes the following," Helen Liggett writes in her book <i>Urban Encounters</i>. "The city exists as a place."<a name="_ednref5"></a><a
href="#_edn5">[5]</a> But narrative, as Jean François Lyotard framed the postmodern condition, no longer holds up in the age of databases and
techno-mastery. Narratives are too stable. They codify experience in referential ways; they work to legitimize experience. "The best performativity
[of narrative] cannot consist in obtaining additional information in this way," Lyotard notes. "It comes rather from arranging the data in a new way,
which is what constitutes a 'move' properly speaking. This new arrangement is usually achieved by connecting together series of data that were
previously held to be independent."<a name="_ednref6"></a><a href="#_edn6">[6]</a> Assemblage works from that basic principle of parataxical
arrangement and opposes the ordered assembly of narrative. "Capital will save Detroit" marks one failed narrative circulated among the city's
investors, politicians, and real estate companies. Returning to this narrative will do us little good. Instead, we must connect its claim to other
data not yet considered relevant or legitimate in urban discourse.

<p>Detroit exists as a place without stability and without legitimization. This lack of stability does not depend on global markets or price
fluctuations or even issues of labor. We already recognize narratives of Detroit which pose the city in such terms: urban flight, failure to adapt to
new global trade, lost revenue in tax assessment and collection, large-scale unemployment. Detroit's lack of stability comes from elsewhere; it comes
from space. From 8 Mile to Jefferson Avenue, lived in and inhabited spaces are encircled by empty spaces. The empty spaces which comprise large parts
of the city pose the possibility of assemblage (combining spaces) as opposed to assembling (filling in space with investment). But until now, we've
spent too much time lamenting over economic revival in terms of space. Whether framed in the repetitive gesture of urban renewal or the more eclectic
appeal of what Richard Florida hails as the creative class, an economic vision of the city demands that we see its return in purely financial terms.
Florida's manifesto, <i>The Rise of the Creative Class</i>, sets the conditions for how the urban environment will be revitalized by the economic
output of young urban professionals (most of whom are artistic and energetic). The presence of such professionals, Florida claims, will lead to urban
recovery as these individuals' interests spur and give rise to new development. It's a popular trope adopted by many states and local
governments, among them Michigan's governor, Jennifer Granholm, who appropriates Florida's concept as the basis of her "Cool Cities" program of urban
renewal. Detroit has been marked as space within the "Cool Cities" plan.  The presence of cool people, the plan proclaims, will make the city
referentially cool, and thus, in line with Florida's argument, elevate financial growth.

<p>In <i>Cities: Reimagining the Urban</i>, Ash Amin and Nigel Thrift, however, propose an alternative agenda for city planning, one which requests
that we view cities in non-economic terms. "Can we see cities as something other than localized economic systems or the forcing houses of (knowledge)
capitalism?"<a name="_ednref7"></a><a href="#_edn7">[7]</a> It's a question I take seriously for how it moves us outside of narrative. It is no longer
possible to theorize all of our problems in terms of capital without also acknowledging that new media plays an equally dominant (or possibly more
dominant) role in shaping culture. But what is this "something other" Amin and Thrift hint at? And what is this role I imagine new media having in
city revival?


<p><br>

<b><p>Encounters </b>

<p>Amin and Thrift ask us to consider the encounter. "The sense of a kaleidoscopic urban world," Amin and Thrift write, "crammed full with hybrid
networks going about their business, enables us to see, at the same time, the importance of <i>encounter</i>."<a name="_ednref8"></a><a
href="#_edn8">[8]</a> Networks embrace the logic of encounter. Amin and Thrift note:

<blockquote>

So, places, for example, are best thought of not so much as enduring sites but as moments of encounter, not so much as "presents"; fixed in space and
time, but as variable events; twists and fluxes of interrelation. Even when the intent is to hold places stiff and motionless, caught in a cat's
cradle of networks that are out to quell unpredictability, success is rare, and then only for awhile.<a name="_ednref9"></a><a href="#_edn9">[9]</a>

</blockquote>

<p>In the network, one moves from place to place, rather than settling in one place. "The insidious thing about electronic networks," Steven Shaviro
writes, "is that they are always there, whether you pay attention to them or not."<a name="_ednref10"></a><a href="#_edn10">[10]</a> Detroit as
network operates from within those moments we pay attention to it, as well as those we don't. The city as network requires a reimagining of how we
move and engage information <i>within</i> (i.e. to and from) places instead of focusing solely on our experience <i>in</i> places (the
Compuware/TechTown model). The difference is substantial. By imagining the urban environment as one of encounter rather than fixed place, we can begin
to conceptualize a city like Detroit as a network (and, in turn, we see other 21st century cities as networks as well). In that conceptualization, we
see the ways new media may reshape our understanding of information technology and the urban.  In essence, we see a project worthy of digital media.

<p>The problem is that even while the city calls itself Digital Detroit, it does not see itself yet as the embodiment of digital media; i.e. the
network. It still sees itself as fixed place. The 20th century marked the great migrations to cities for purposes of work. Detroit, along with Chicago
and Cleveland, served as a major destination point for those in search of a fixed place within the American promise of post-War economic recovery. The
21st century fails to continue this distinction, partly because those fixed places no longer exist. The automotive factories which spurred the great
migrations have since closed or minimized operations. The factory signifies the place we pay attention to; the time has come to locate the places we
don't pay attention to, the places we have yet to encounter, in order to shape Detroit as a network. In the age of information, we don't head towards
a place, but rather encounter place, real or imaginary. We enter into place. When Detroit-based DJ Jay Dee poses as a mix the broad declaration
"Welcome To Detroit" on his album of the same name, he highlights this encounter as one into the network of information culture. In other words, to be
welcomed into Detroit is to be welcomed into the encounter as mix.

<p>In the collection <i>Stalking Detroit</i>, Jason Young poses this mix encounter as an update of the Situationist practice of psychogeography.
Young's project, <i>Line Frustration</i>, is a mapping of Detroit whose purpose is to move outside of fixed, economic solutions by mixing physical
space with imagination, or the places we wouldn't normally pay attention to. "<i>Line Frustration</i> describes the brokering of Detroit's empty
territory by the media and attempts to locate architecture's potential fit within that economy."<a name="_ednref11"></a><a href="#_edn11">[11]</a>
Young describes his work of mapping out lines across the city as being about writing. "In many ways," he states, "this line of demarcation is
rhetorical. It separates <i>this</i> from more of <i>this</i>. The line's intention is to introduce difference where there is none."<a
name="_ednref12"></a><a href="#_edn12">[12]</a>  A mix of real place (where the lines meet) and imaginary place (where I project them) produces
encounter. When I project Detroit as a network of encounters, I am focusing on this sense of difference in terms of new media. I am calling for new
types of mapping of place, particularly mappings which move within the logic of digital culture by allowing us to encounter new kinds of urban spaces
as writing. "The full blown city coincides with the development of writing," McLuhan writes.<a name="_ednref13"></a><a href="#_edn13">[13]</a> "New
speed and power are never compatible with existing spatial and social arrangements."<a name="_ednref14"></a><a href="#_edn14">[14]</a> To reimagine
the city as digital media is to reimagine its space as writing, a move which displaces us from current social arrangements whose focus rests mostly
with capital investment. Thus, this becomes both an ideological move (a recognition of an apparatus shift in information technology and space which
moves us from assembly line to assemblage thinking) as well as a practical move (residents engage with this shift in thinking in order to begin
writing the city through encounters). Central to this writing is imagination in terms of materiality, how we imagine the places we live within in
regards to technology.

<p>In the Fordist-economy, that imagination occurs as graffiti. Long distained as symbolic of urban blight, graffiti has been viewed as the sign of
economic decline; its appearance often found on the remnants of the industrial age: trains, factory walls, abandoned buildings, highway bypasses, and
street signs. When one encounters this graffiti, one sees the collapse of urbanity. Graffiti long positioned itself as the re-imagination of failed
social space. The industrial city, like Detroit, eventually became covered in the urban phenomenon of graffiti tags. The weblog dETROITfUNK
(<a href="http://www.detroitfunk.com/dfg/">www.detroitfunk.com/dfg</a>) wonderfully showcases Detroit's urban tags through a series of posted galleries. As the site demonstrates, "Rodeo,"
Turtl," "Money," and "Rib" sign Detroit's urban landscape as industrial writing. These graffiti tags reference the urban city in familiar ways. They
capture our attention through their references to decay and collapse. How to move that familiarity into digital writing or mapping so that we engage
encounter as not fixed signings, but as what we haven't yet considered or paid attention to; i.e., assemblages?

<p>Whereas the industrial city was marked by graffiti tags, the information city is marked by the less familiar, XML driven tag. The XML tag is the
meta-level mark-up used to categorize information in both referential and non-referential ways. Popularized on websites like the image sharing site
Flickr, the social bookmarking system Del.icio.us, and the link hub Metafilter, tags allow writers to designate their own names and attributes to
information (as opposed to relying on previous categorical systems in circulation). These kinds of sites often draw attention to encounters (names,
categories, places) we wouldn't normally recognize. Systems like Flickr or Del.icio.us are presented as "social" systems because of the levels of
social interaction encouraged through user participation and the new kinds of arrangements of information they encourage. By tagging (i.e.
categorizing) spaces in flexible manners (the categories are open to change and combinations), these set-ups alter our understanding of social space.
In Del.icio.us, these encounters occur through like-minded tags of bookmarked space, which become interlinked (assembled) among users who have chosen
the same categories unbeknownst to each other. Flickr, in particular, has generated the notion of the memory map, a tagged satellite map where users
fill in their own categories of place through annotated notes.<a name="_ednref15"></a><a href="#_edn15">[15]</a> In the memory map, the fixed markers
of place (street names, industrial zones, storefronts) become joined with user-oriented definitions, often framed in terms of personal relationships
and experiences ("where we first kissed," "I learned to read English here," "when the circus stopped here that year, I knew I had made the wrong
career choice").  The memory map is a new kind of urban space, an assemblage of the familiar and unfamiliar through tagging. The memory map begins the
process of encountering places we pay attention to and those we don't. It digitally updates Young's project of empty territory and line mapping. The
memory map as tagged experience points towards an emerging idea of digital urbanity.

<p>Whereas HTML works with pre-established tags like <b> (bold) or <i> (italicize), XML's meta-tag is left open as < >. The openness
allows a variety of organizational schemes to occur as users complete the tags based on reference, desire, association, lack of reference, or some
other means. This process is known as folksonomy (folk + taxonomy). Folksonomy involves a new media organization of space through the meeting of
differently arranged, open schemes. Just as the urban city contributed to a sense of public-ness or folk-ness through communal gathering, the
café, public squares, stadiums, and other places, folksonomy generates a digital sense of connectedness. It does so, however, not through fixed
place but through the open encounter of place in terms of digital, social interaction.

<p>Through this openness and interaction, the meta-tag generates assemblages, information connections where such connections were not initially
acknowledged as existing. Tagging, David Weinberger writes, allows "us to type in any word we want, rather than forcing us to navigate some
hierarchical, controlled vocabulary."<a name="_ednref16"></a><a href="#_edn16">[16]</a> Through tagging, the digital allows us to engage in discursive
encounter. We discover the encounter among tags, among users who tag, and among user and tag. Various combination schemes emerge out of these
encounters, sometimes as maps, sometimes as bookmarking, sometimes in other formations. These schemes prompt questions predetermined naming does not
allow: What do I want to name this place? How do I want to identify that naming with another related or unrelated place? How do I allow my naming to
connect with other names created throughout the Web? How might I name myself within this place? Tagging leaves these options up to the writer. When
writing becomes tagging, associative combinations become rhetorical principles. These associations form digital networks, and thus, digital urban
spaces.


<p><br>

<b><p>Detroit Tagging </b>

<p>How, then, might we "tag" the information technology city like Detroit?  Not with spray paint, but with naming structures. In a city awash with
empty buildings and abandoned sites, the potential for open tagging <> seems endless. What to name these abandoned spaces? What to rename those filled
in spaces whose financial schemes have failed? How might this assemblage-oriented naming reimagine the ways we have relied upon referentiality for
urban renewal? Referentiality, of course, is the basis of print culture. But Detroit is no longer a product of that culture, and that is why Richard
Florida's graphs and diagrams of equation between specific types of individuals and urban economic potential cannot pan out. "Our theory," Florida
argues, "is that a connection exists between a metropolitan area's level of tolerance for a range of people, its ethnic and social diversity, and its
success in attracting talented people, including high-technology workers."<a name="_ednref17"></a><a href="#_edn17">[17]</a> Digitality places that
referentiality under question. TechTown or Compuware, these are plans whose basis as well is in referentiality. This kind of technology driven vision
attempts to equate itself (as reference) with financial payoff. Tagging is a different logic altogether.

<p>My argument is that the connections Florida stresses are not found in a causal or referential relationship among individuals, capital, the city
or other forces,  but rather in the new media logic of assemblage; that is, combination in general. In the assemblage, reference is not a requirement.
The social connectivity planners like Florida believe will emerge out of urban renewal may be better actualized through the digital assemblage of
tagging. My call is for a plan of information tagging, where residents, working in digital spaces, reimagine the city through their own
conceptualization and actualization of tags.  In place of tagging the bypass or the stop sign with graffiti, they tag the city itself as an
encountered name or moment within a digital, interconnected space. On the Web, these encounters become moments of discursive interaction and
combination as others add to the tags with their own tagging attributes. "The history of urbanism," Steven Johnson notes, "is also the story of more
muted signs, built by the collective behavior of smaller groups and rarely detected by outsiders."<a name="_ednref18"></a><a href="#_edn18">[18]</a>
Tagging brings this behavior to the foreground so that social connectivity is generated among those within the recognized urban space and those often
deemed "outsiders" (those who bring new naming conventions to the discussion and to the urban space itself). If there, in fact, exists a Digital
Detroit as this city claims for itself, than it must be found within the practice of tagging.

<p>Detroit, like the urban experience in general, has become non-referential.  Its empty spaces, or "ruins" as the Fabulous Ruins of Detroit website
declares <a name="_ednref19"></a><a href="#_edn19">[19]</a>, don't refer to anything anymore. Tagging allows us to transform that non-referentiality
into social experience. The lesson of Detroit is a lesson for all urban sites. Digital space becomes social space through assembled meanings, and that
assemblage actualizes the popular logic of social software.<a name="_ednref20"></a><a href="#_edn20">[20]</a> Tagging, then, marks a place where new
media logic informs our understanding of space and the urban, fashioning a sense of the "social" not yet accounted for in urban studies. Imagine,
then, the city as a network of tags. Residents, who tag themselves simultaneously as writers or non-writers, mark the city through memory maps,
weblogs, del.icio.us tags, and other related tools in order to reconstruct the city's sense of urbanity as a digital experience. The tagging generates
a number of assembled taxonomies, some recognizable, many not. Through the assemblages, we find new Detroits to engage. We find new Detroits emerging
out of our own discursive constructions. This reworking is social in ways capital investment has failed to generate. By making these cities cyber --
that is, by putting them on the Web -- the tags used to develop these spaces will inevitably be linked to other similarly named tags <i>for other
cities, for other, not yet imagined, encounters</i>.
