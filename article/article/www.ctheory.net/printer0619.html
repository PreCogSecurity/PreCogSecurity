<p>All moist life is inside now. Dark oases of banks, hotels,
<br>restaurants, avid hearts. Valves open, glass doors sluice
<br>heavily inward all hours day and night vegetal interiors
<br>-- we are consumers. Sudden biologic air light water. 
<br>Tendrils of machinery alleviate the body, green plants florescent
<br>liquids circuitries of oxygen nutrients through skins of semi-
<br>human buildings, tubes wires electric cells inside walls
<br>pump what is left of earth from a deep place into our
<br>veins. From the ice of mental systems into our final
<br>thoughts
<br>             Terrariums, aquarium fish enjoy the same
<br>ambience (if plunged in a desert of fire, enact careers
<br>on the surface of Mars). This is how it feels.
<br>                     Clocks, all coordinates of time and space
<br>intersections of philosophy metallurgy famine sex
<br>become this place. Watery exchanges of money, historic
<br>lips hands palms genital intellect and soft pulses of
<br>bodies doing business. Little sweats of laughter. Your
<br>interchangeable face
<br>             Almost among rainforest of planters wooden
<br>boxes automatic drip salad bars, euphoric negative ions
<br>stainless coffee coca chrome. Something feeds, that
<br>mysterious gut. Deliver us, from thirst from depths
<br>complex artificial suckt and pumped Inside terminal
<br>flesh; breathe see swallow urine spit shit (even us).
<br>              This is how bodies are kept alive
